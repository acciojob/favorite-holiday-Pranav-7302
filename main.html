	<h1>Ayodhya</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Ayodhya, located in Uttar Pradesh, India, is one of the most significant cities in Hinduism. It is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Rama, the seventh avatar of Vishnu, and is a key site in the Ramayana. The city holds immense religious and historical importance, attracting millions of devotees and tourists.

Ayodhya has been at the center of major historical and political events, including the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi dispute. The construction of the grand Ram Mandir, inaugurated in January 2024, has further elevated its spiritual significance.

Apart from its religious heritage, Ayodhya is also known for its ancient temples, ghats, and vibrant cultural traditions. The city is undergoing rapid development to enhance tourism and infrastructure, making it a blend of history, faith, and modernization. ðŸš©</p>
